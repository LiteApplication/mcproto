Code of Conduct
===============

..
    TODO: Rewrite the code of conduct here directly, rather than including it
    like this, and just include a link to the docs in CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md

    Temporarily using ``.. mdinclude:: ../../CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md`` doesn't work,
    as it contains multiple references to same URLs,  and while m2r2 has
    --anonymous-references option, it doesn't seem like it's possible to use it
    with .. mdinclude
