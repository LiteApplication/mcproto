Add attributetable internal sphinx extension for showing all attributes and methods for specified classes.

- This adds `attributetable` sphinx directive, which can be used before autodoc directive. This will create the attribute table, which will get dynamically moved right below the class definition from autodoc (using javascript).
- This extension was implemented by [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/blob/2fdbe59376d736483cd1226e674e609433877af4/docs/extensions/attributetable.py), this is just re-using that code, with some modifications to fit our code style and to fit the documentation design (furo theme).
