Rework deprecation system
- Drop support for date-based deprecations, versions work better
- Provide `deprecation_warn` function, which emits warnings directly, no need for a decorator
- Add a `SemanticVersion` class, supporting version comparisons
- If the project's version is already higher than the specified deprecation removal version, raise a DeprecationWarning
  as a full exception (rather than just a warning).
